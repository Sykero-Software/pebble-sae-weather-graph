## Project Overview

This is a Pebble smartwatch application written in C using the Pebble SDK.

Emery (Time 2) is the only supported platform.

## Commands

See README.md. In short, use Makefile rules. Use the `pebble` CLI to run more
specific commands, such as controlling the emulator or taking screenshots.

## Project Structure

```
src/c/           - C source files for the watchapp
src/pkjs/        - PebbleKitJS files (currently empty)
worker_src/c/    - Worker source files (optional, not present)
resources/       - Images, fonts, and other resources (not present)
```

## Architecture

The application follows the standard Pebble app architecture:

1. **Main Entry Point**: `src/c` - The `main()` function initializes the app and starts the event loop
2. **Window Management**: Multi-window app.
3. **Event Handling**: Button click handlers registered via `prv_click_config_provider` for UP, DOWN, and SELECT buttons

## SDK Documentation

The full Pebble SDK documentation is available at https://developer.repebble.com.

An index of every page is at https://developer.repebble.com/llms.txt. Use it to discover what's available. Every page also has a Markdown version: append `.md` to any documentation URL to fetch plain Markdown instead of HTML (e.g. `https://developer.repebble.com/guides/events-and-services/buttons.md`). Prefer the `.md` form when reading docs.

## Development Best Practices

- Whenever making changes, run `pebble screenshot --scale 6` and view the screenshot to make sure it's what the user requested. If not, make more changes until it does what it's supposed to.

## Emulator Button Control

Control emulator buttons programmatically with `pebble emu-button`:

```bash
# Click a button (press and release)
pebble emu-button click select

# Long press (e.g., 2 seconds to exit app)
pebble emu-button click back --duration 2000

# Repeat clicks (e.g., scroll down 5 times)
pebble emu-button click down --repeat 5

# Faster repeat interval
pebble emu-button click up --repeat 3 --interval 100
```

**Actions:**
- `click` - Press then release (use `--duration` for long press)
- `push` - Hold button down (use `release` to let go)
- `release` - Release all buttons

**Buttons:** `back`, `up`, `select`, `down`

**Best Practices:**
- Use `click` for normal navigation and selection
- Use `click --duration 2000` for long press (e.g., back button to exit)
- Use `--repeat` to scroll through menus instead of multiple commands
- After making UI changes, take a screenshot to verify the result

## AI Code Review Guidelines

- Once you think you've fulfilled the user's request, ask yourself if you see any issues with the current screenshot, and if there are any differences between the screenshot and the reference image or the user's description. If so, fix them.
